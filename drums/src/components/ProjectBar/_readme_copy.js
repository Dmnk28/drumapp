const readme_copy = `# FCC Drum Machine Project
This Project was build during the Front End Development Libraries Course at [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/). 

To be honest it wasn't my favorite Project in the Curriculum and therefore I didn't efford much time in styling everything and so on.

Besides the Project I had the Idea to implement a little Projectbar for my React Applications so potential recruiters could easily get a look at Code, Passwords for Test-Accounts (if elsewise a registration would be needed like in a web shop project for example). 

It should serve to get the Users back to my Portfoliopage, repectively LinkedIn / Github account, or to direct them to an other online presence of mine, they didn't came from but could be interessted in.
