# FCC Drum Machine Project
This Project was build during the Front End Development Libraries Course at [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/). 

# What I Learned
Well, I was able to practice the usage of audio-files in react. Audio (& Video) files, I have to admit, aren't my everyday bussiness. Thats simply due to me never needing it and that I am not the kind of person who produces a lot of audio/video files himself. 

So the little extra practice was definitly good for me!

To be honest it wasn't my favorite project in the curriculum and therefore I didn't efford much time in styling everything and so on.

# The ProjectBar
While working on the Project I had the Idea to implement a little Projectbar for my React applications so potential recruiters could easily get a look at the README and the code, could jumb to the next project, my portfolio or linkedIn-profile. In later projects it should contain Passwords for Test-Accounts (if a registration would be needed like in a web shop project for example). 

## Project-URL:
You theoretically would find the project in the wild on my [webpage](https://do-webdev.de/), which is under construction at the moment. 
But the Poems are already reachable: [https://do-webdev.de/projects/drums/](https://do-webdev.de/projects/drums/).
